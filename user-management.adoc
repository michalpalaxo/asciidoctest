= CIRCULARO USER MANAGEMENT

== Introduction

Every user who wishes to use Circularo must have a dedicated user account. Because of this, every Circularo user only has access to those areas of the system which they have previously been assigned rights. In this way, the system prevents all unauthorized access to information stored within Circularo. In addition, you can limit each user's access to certain functions, so that you can completely avoid incorrect operations. However, you can also provide users with a certain amount of freedom in organizing their documents etc.

In this administration section, you can configure user management. In the following tabs you can create and service all corresponding settings.

* Users
* Groups
* ACLs
* Rights

== Setting up users and groups

You can create each user by his name and assign him to an unlimited number of groups. Each group includes as many users as desired and you can modify it at any time. Users within a group are handled equally and have identical functional rights. The use of groups greatly simplifies user right servicing and maintenance.

== Setting up ACLs and defining rights

By using ACLs, you can define the rights for the various users in your company based on the different job descriptions of people working with Circularo (e.g. editing, viewing, administration, etc.). You can link each group to a specific ACL. You can assign an ACL itself to any number of groups. Since the system uses the ACL name to establish this linkage, you can subsequently modify the rights for each ACL.

It is also possible to define access rights to documents types (see below) by using template specific ACLs. Ideally, for every action or procedure performed in your company connected to Circularo, you can define a corresponding ACL.

== Search Function in the User Administration

Under the tabs, you find the user management Search field.

This function is available for every tab (user, groups, acls, right) in the same way. Enter the search term in the input field. The system lists all entries which contain the search term at the beginning.

== Users

* If you want to edit an existing user, click on the appropriate entry in the list of users, the edit dialog will open
* If you need to create a new user, click the [Add user] button
